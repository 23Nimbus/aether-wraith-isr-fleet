orchestrator.py
---------------

This module acts as a simple scheduler and router for the Ã†ther Wraith ISR
Fleet.  It loads a YAML schedule (see `tasks/schedule.yaml`) and, on
invocation, checks which tasks should run at the current time.  For the
purposes of this skeleton it executes all configured actions immediately
when run.

The orchestrator writes an `orchestration_log.json` file to record when
actions were invoked.  This log can be used for auditing and replay.
