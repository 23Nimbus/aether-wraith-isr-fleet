# Copy this file to `.env` and populate the variables with values for your
# local development or deployment environment.  Do NOT commit the filled
# `.env` file to version control.  The docker-compose file and scripts
# reference these environment variables when connecting to external
# services such as MQTT brokers or cloud APIs.

# Example: MQTT credentials for connecting to an authenticated broker.
MQTT_USERNAME=your_username
MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password

# Example: API keys or tokens used by the AI service or external APIs.
