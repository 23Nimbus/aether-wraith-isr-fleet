Placeholder model file for the anomaly classifier.

This file is intentionally small and acts as a sentinel for the presence of
a trained anomaly classifier.  When a real model becomes available it should
be exported using `joblib.dump` and replace the contents of this file.  The
AI agent in `agents/aether_ai.py` will attempt to load the model from this
location when performing classification.
