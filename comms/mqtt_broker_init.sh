# Initialise a local MQTT broker for the Ã†ther Wraith simulation network.  In a
# real deployment this might start Mosquitto or EMQX via Docker.  On
# constrained systems without Docker you can substitute an appropriate
# broker command.  This script is intentionally idempotent: if the broker
# is already running it will do nothing.
